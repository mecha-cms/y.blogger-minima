This is not a clone of the original Minima template. I didnâ€™t make it from the original source code, but by refactoring
it using more modern CSS and HTML syntax.

### Features

Other color variants of this template have been combined into one. You can enable other color variants via
`.\lot\y\blogger-minima\state.php` file:

~~~ .php
<?php

return [
    'banner' => null,
    'color' => [
        'description' => '#cccccc',
        'title' => '#ffffff'
    ],
    'skin' => ['name' => 'white']
];
~~~

The default color variant is `white`. There are several other color variants you can try, including `black`, `blue`, and
`ochre`. These are the official color variants provided by the designer of this template in the past. The `brick` ones
were made by me.

You can add an image URL to the `banner` property to set a background image of the header. The image will automatically
resize to fit its container.
